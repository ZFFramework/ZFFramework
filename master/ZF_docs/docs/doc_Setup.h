 * it's recommended to use <a href="https://github.com/ZFFramework/ZFFramework/blob/master/tools/zfproj_creator/zfproj_creator.sh">zfproj_creator.sh</a> for quick setup\n
 * \n
 * the tools would help you create all necessary project files for you,
 * however, you still need to setup proper IDE and system settings manually,
 * see each platform spec for more info\n
 * \n
 * after setup, simply add your own cpp files to `zfsrc` dir,
 * they would be compiled automatically for all projects
 *
